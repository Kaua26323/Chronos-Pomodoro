        <h1>The Pomodoro Technique 🍅</h1>
        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity methodology created by{' '}
          <strong>Francesco Cirillo</strong>, which consists of dividing work
          into time blocks (the famous "Pomodoros") interspersed with breaks.
          The goal is to maintain total focus for a short period and ensure rest
          to avoid mental fatigue.
        </p>

        <h2>How does the traditional Pomodoro work?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Define a task</strong> you want to accomplish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Work on it for 25 minutes</strong> without interruptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Take a short 5-minute break</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. Every 4 cycles, take a long break</strong> (usually 15 to
            30 minutes).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          But <strong>Chronos Pomodoro</strong> has a special feature 🚀
        </h2>

        <p>
          Our app follows the original concept, but with some improvements and
          customizations to make the process even more efficient:
        </p>

        <h3>⚙️ Time customization</h3>
        <p>
          You can configure the focus time, short break, and long break however
          you want! Just access the <a href='/settings'>settings page</a> and
          adjust the minutes as you prefer.
        </p>

        <h3>🔁 Cycles organized in sequence</h3>
        <p>
          With each completed cycle, a new task is automatically added to your
          history, and the app already suggests the next cycle (focus or break).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our default:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Odd</strong> cycles: Work (focus).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Even</strong> cycles: Short break.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cycle <strong>8</strong>: Special long break to reset the full
            cycle.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🍅 Cycle visualization</h3>
        <p>
          Right below the timer, you will see colored dots with icons
          representing the cycles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔴 Red: Work cycle (focus).</li>
          <li>🟢 Green: Short break.</li>
          <li>🔵 Blue: Long break (appears every 8 cycles).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This way, you always know what part of the process you are in and what
          comes next. No more writing on paper or calculating in your head!
        </p>

        <h3>📊 Automatic history</h3>
        <p>
          All your completed tasks and cycles are saved in the{' '}
          <a href='/history'>history</a>, with completed or interrupted status.
          This allows you to track your progress over time.
        </p>
